# My API Documentation Portfolio  
**Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing API documentation samples** that I have created as part of my practice in technical writing. Please note that due to confidentiality agreements with my previous employers, these samples are *fictional* and not based on real-world projects. They are designed to demonstrate my ability to create clear, user-friendly, and structured API documentation.

## How I Approach API Documentation

**When documenting APIs, I focus on:**

1. _Collaboration with subject-matter experts_- Ensuring I understand both the technical and business goals of the API and how to use it.
2. _Test the API_ - Get a clear understanding of the API Endpoints and methods, data structures, target users and workflows.
3. _User workflows and business value_ - Providing clarity description and actionable documentation to engage users.
4. _Developer-Centric Focus_ - Including detailed code samples and highlighting use cases that help developers integrate APIs quickly and effectively.
5. Consistency_ - Maintaining consistent style and terminology throughout the documentation to avoid confusion.
6. _Interactive Elements_ -Where applicable, I provide interactive examples or Postman collections to allow users to test endpoints easily.
