# Technical-Write Me  
## API Documentation Showcase  

**Welcome to Technical-Write Me, my API documentation portfolio**. My name is Javier Hernández and I'm a Senior Technical Writer and Documentation Manager.   

The following API documentation samples consist of my _version_ or _revamping_ of some publicly available API documentation sets to demonstrate my ability to create clear, effective, user-friendly, and structured API documentation.


## Crafting an Valuable and Effective API Documentation  

_TO DO_  

**When documenting APIs, I focus on:**

1. _Collaboration with subject-matter experts_- Ensuring I understand both the technical and business goals of the API and how to use it.
2. _Test the API_ - Get a clear understanding of the API Endpoints and methods, data structures, target users and workflows.
3. _User workflows and business value_ - Providing clarity description and actionable documentation to engage users.
4. _Developer-Centric Focus_ - Including detailed code samples and highlighting use cases that help developers integrate APIs quickly and effectively.
5. Consistency_ - Maintaining consistent style and terminology throughout the documentation to avoid confusion.
6. _Interactive Elements_ -Where applicable, I provide interactive examples or Postman collections to allow users to test endpoints easily.
