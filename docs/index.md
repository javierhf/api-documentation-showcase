# Technical-Write Me: API Documentation Portfolio    

**Welcome to my API documentation repository. Here you will find API documentation samples** to demonstrate my knowledge, practice and ideas about successful documentation. 

**Due to confidentiality agreements** with my previous employers, these samples are *fictional* or present my version of real-world publicly accessible documentation project to demonstrate my ability to create clear, user-friendly, and structured API documentation.

## Overview

**The samples in this repository are fictional representations of my ideas and practice**, illustrating my skills in showcase the important parts for an API documentation to be effective and successful.

Feel free to explore these examples to get an understanding of how I approach API documentation.

## How I Approach API Documentation

**When documenting APIs, I focus on:**

1. _Collaboration with subject-matter experts_- Ensuring I understand both the technical and business goals of the API and how to use it.
2. _Test the API_ - Get a clear understanding of the API Endpoints and methods, data structures, target users and workflows.
3. _User workflows and business value_ - Providing clarity description and actionable documentation to engage users.
4. _Developer-Centric Focus_ - Including detailed code samples and highlighting use cases that help developers integrate APIs quickly and effectively.
5. Consistency_ - Maintaining consistent style and terminology throughout the documentation to avoid confusion.
6. _Interactive Elements_ -Where applicable, I provide interactive examples or Postman collections to allow users to test endpoints easily.
