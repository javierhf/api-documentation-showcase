# Technical-Write Me  
## Overview      

!!! info "Source and Scope"    

    Due to confidentiality agreements with previous employers, I cannot showcase current work samples. Instead, I've revamped API documentation from publicly accessible projects to demonstrate my technical writing expertise, practice, and approach to effective documentation.

**Welcome to Technical-Write Me, my professional portfolio** where you will find API documentation samples that I have revamped to demonstrate practice and ideas about effective technical documentation.  


## API Documentation Samples

## Crafting API Documentation
### What is API Documentation?
**API documentation is a comprehensive set of documents designed to enable users to work efficiently with our API**. Our documentation serves two primary user groups, each with distinct needs:

* *Current Users*: Require in-depth understanding to onboard new team members and utilize the API comprehensively.
* *Potential Users*: Need quick insights to evaluate the API's business value and potential integration.

### Why API Documentation?
API documentation serves critical strategic objectives:  

* Demonstrate API value proposition to potential users.  
* Provide current users with comprehensive management capabilities.  
* Facilitate smooth technical integration and adoption.

### How to Structure API Documentation?  

API documentation typically encompasses two fundamental categories:  

* _Conceptual Documentation_: Introduces API concepts, workflows, and getting started guidance for all user levels.  
* _Reference Documentation_: Delivers granular, technical details about API endpoints, parameters, and specifications.

**Each documentation type targets specific user needs**, ensuring comprehensive understanding and effective implementation as shown in the following table:

| Type of Documentation | Description | Goal | Topics |  
| ---------------------- | ---------- | ------| ---------- |  
| **Conceptual documentation** | Curated content to get started and grasp the value of our API.  | Enable users and potential users to start working with our API. | <ul><li>Overview</li><li>Getting Started</li><li>Tutorials</li><li>Authentication and Authorization</li><li>Rate Limits and Thresholds</li><li>SDK and Code Samples</li><li>Changelog</li><li>FAQ</li></ul>|  
| **Reference documentation** | Descriptive content of all the component parts and setups of our API. | Provide a complete information regarding all the aspects of the API. | <ul><li>Overview</li><li>Security:<ul><li>Authorization</li><li>Authentication</li></ul></li><li>Rate Limits and Thresholds</li><li>Resources:<ul><li>Resources</li><li>Endpoints</li><li>Methods</li><li>Parameters</li><li>Request Example</li><li>Response Example</li><li>Status and Error Codes</li></ul><li>Glossary</li></ul> | 


## Preparing for Your API Documentation  

**Before starting to draft or API documentation** you need to understand your API from both a business perspective, and design-coding perspective. This will help you to create user-centered and efficient documentation.   

To do so, it is highly recommended to:  

* Discuss your API's business value with stakeholders/product owners.
* Study and learn to your API's specification and code.
* Participate in design and development meetings from early stages.  
* Know your users and their workflows.
  
## Best Practices  

**API Documentation is an iterative project** that needs to be review, test, and maintain on a regular basis. To succeed, apply the following best practices:  

| Practice | Goal/Benefit |  
| ---------- | --------------- |  
| **Collaborate with Subject-Matter Experts** | Ensuring you understand both the technical and business goals of the API and how to use it. |  
| **Test Your API** | Get a clear understanding of the API Endpoints and methods, data structures, target users and workflows. A testing environment is a _must_. |  
| **User Personas and User Journey** | Understand your users' workflows helps you to provide clear and efficient documents with easily actionable instructions to engage users. |  
| **Developer-Centric Focus** | Include detailed code samples and highlighting use cases that help developers integrate APIs quickly and effectively. |  
| **Templates and Style Guide** | Maintaining consistent style and terminology throughout the documentation to avoid confusion. |  
| **Interactive Elements** | Where applicable, I provide interactive examples or Postman collections to allow users to test endpoints easily. |
