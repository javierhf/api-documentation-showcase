# Technical-Write Me  
## Overview      

!!! info "Source and Scope"    

    Due to confidentiality agreements with previous employers, I cannot showcase current work samples. Instead, I've revamped API documentation from publicly accessible projects to demonstrate my technical writing expertise, practice, and approach to effective documentation.

**Welcome to Technical-Write Me, my professional portfolio**. Here I share some learning notes about API documentation and feature my knowledge and practice through the following revamped examples of public API documentation sets.  

| API Name | Description | Approach | My Version | Original Source |  
| --------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------------ |  
| OpenWeather - One Call 3.0 | _Coming Soon!_ | Traditional reference style | [Here]() |  [OpenWeather original documentation]() |  
| Swagger Pet Store | _Coming Soon!_ | User-centered design | [Here]() | [Swagger Pet Store]() |

## About API Documetation  
### What is API Documentation?
**API documentation is a comprehensive set of documents designed to enable users to work efficiently with our API**. API documentation *must address two key audiences*, each with unique needs and goals as shown in the following table:  

| Audience | Description | Goals |  
| ------------ | --------- | ----------- |  
| **Current Users** | Developers who need comprehensive material. |<ul><li>Onboard their new team members</li><li>Maintain existing integrations</li></ul> |  
| **Potential Users** | Developers or decision-makers evaluating the API. | <ul><li>Evaluate the API's capabilities</li><li>Integration efforts</li><li>Business value</li></ul> |

### Why API Documentation?  

**API as a product has specific documentation needs** and serves the following critical strategic objectives:  

* Demonstrate API value proposition to potential users  
* Provide current users with comprehensive management capabilities  
* Facilitate smooth technical integration and adoption

### How to Structure API Documentation?  

**API documentation discloses all the information users require to**:  

* Get started with the API  
* Perform all the available actions  
* Set up an efficient configuration  
* Autonomous troubleshooting  

**API documentation typically encompasses two fundamental categories** each with their specific structure, and targeting different user needs, as described in the following table:

| Type of Documentation | Description | Goal | Topics |  
| ---------------------- | ---------- | ------| ---------- |  
| **Conceptual documentation** | Curated content to get started and grasp the value of our API.  | Enable users and potential users to start working with our API. | <ul><li>Overview</li><li>Getting Started</li><li>Tutorials</li><li>Authentication and Authorization</li><li>Rate Limits and Thresholds</li><li>SDK and Code Samples</li><li>Changelog</li><li>FAQ</li></ul>|  
| **Reference documentation** | Descriptive content of all the component parts and setups of our API. | Provide a complete information regarding all the aspects of the API. | <ul><li>Overview</li><li>Security:<ul><li>Authorization</li><li>Authentication</li></ul></li><li>Rate Limits and Thresholds</li><li>Resources:<ul><li>Resources</li><li>Endpoints</li><li>Methods</li><li>Parameters</li><li>Request Example</li><li>Response Example</li><li>Status and Error Codes</li></ul><li>Glossary</li></ul> |   

**However, API documentation should be adapted** to best serve your users' needs and business objectives.


## Preparing for Your API Documentation  

**Before starting to draft or API documentation** you need to understand your API from both a business perspective, and design-coding perspective. This will help you to create user-centered and efficient documentation.   

**To do so,** it is highly recommended to:  

* Discuss your API's business value with stakeholders/product owners.
* Study and learn to your API's specification and code.
* Participate in design and development meetings from early stages.  
* Know your users and their workflows.
  
## Best Practices  

**API Documentation is an iterative project** that needs to be review, test, and maintain on a regular basis.  

**Check the following tabl**, to learn more about best practices:  

| Practice | Goal/Benefit |  
| ---------- | --------------- |  
| **Collaborate with Subject-Matter Experts** | Ensuring you understand both the technical and business goals of the API and how to use it. |  
| **Test Your API** | Get a clear understanding of the API Endpoints and methods, data structures, target users and workflows. A testing environment is a _must_. |  
| **User Personas and User Journey** | Understand your users' workflows helps you to provide clear and efficient documents with easily actionable instructions to engage users. |  
| **Developer-Centric Focus** | Include detailed code samples and highlighting use cases that help developers integrate APIs quickly and effectively. |  
| **Templates and Style Guide** | Maintaining consistent style and terminology throughout the documentation to avoid confusion. |  
| **Interactive Elements** | Where applicable, I provide interactive examples or Postman collections to allow users to test endpoints easily. |
